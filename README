This is the README file for Overpass-API installation and setup on local
machine running Linux Slackware64 current.

What is OSM Overpass? 
  Quoting from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API:
    
    "The Overpass API (formerly known as OSM Server Side Scripting, or OSM3S
    before 2011) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of 
    the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a 
    query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query."

end quote.

To me Overpass is a tool to retrieve OSM data, similar to another OSM tool 
known as "Nominatim". Overpass is a lot less demanding in terms of hardware
requirements and easier to setup.

Has Its Own Database engine. No need for Postgresql or anything else.

Installation and setup consist of the following steps:

1) Build / compile the source software using SlackBuild script.

2) Populate the Database using the provided software and data source
   file you get from OSM server.
   
3) Setup Apache web server on your local machine to use OverpassAPI.
