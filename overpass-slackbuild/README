OSM OverPass API software

This is the README file for the overpassAPI software slackware build script.

Open Street Maps overpassAPI is a query language for OSM data.
(Formerly known as OSM Server Side Scripting, or OSM3S before 2011)
It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query to the
API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query.

Source url: "https://dev.overpass-api.de/releases/osm-3s_v0.7.56.8.tar.gz"
Please note that the source on github.com is old.
     
Required Packages:

 - expat : provided with Slackware current

Important Notes:
 - This SlackBuild script compiles the overpassAPI software from source,
   package destination {PKGDEST} installation root is set to /usr/local/.
 - This script creates two new directories under /usr/local/ with names
   "cgi-bin" and "templates".
 - Blog directory along with overpass-doc are added to the package in the
   html directory; for educational purposes. Available on the web online too.
 - This script replaces the "index.html" file in the html directory with
   that used in version 0.7.55.9.
 - This script does NOT setup any web server.
 - The overpass dispatcher program should not run as root! To avoid that we
   create an overpass group and user. The recommended GID/UID for overpass
   has been assigned by www.SlackBuilds.org and included in their site in the
   "Recommended UID/GID document" url: www.slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt, big 
   thank you goes to Robby Workman for doing this. You create the group and user
   with the following commands:
     # groupadd -g 367 overpass
     # useradd -u 367 -g 367 -d {DB_ROOT}/overpass overpass
   where {DB_ROOT} is the root directory for the overpass home directory.
   Using this GID/UID (367) avoids conflict with software installed from the
   SlackBuilds.org site, so I highly recommend using this number.
   
The goal is to setup overpassAPI server on a local machine, compiling  and
installing the software is a first step. After installing the package, we
can move to the next step; populate the data base. By the way overpass uses
its own data base engine.
  
Enjoy :)
