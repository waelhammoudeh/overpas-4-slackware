<h1>Glossary</h1>

<p>For OpenStreetMap as well as for the Overpass API, a couple of notions are explained.</p>

<h3>Area</h3>

<p><em>Areas</em> are a special type of object within the Overpass API.
The <em>areas</em> are not part of the OpenStreetMap data opposed to <em>nodes</em>, <em>ways</em>, and <em>relations</em>,
but are generated by Overpass API.
These are a workaround, because <em>areas</em> are used in OpenStreetMap as a concept,
but there is no proper data type for them.</p>

<h3>Bounding Box</h3>

<p>A bounding box is defined by two values for a latitude and two values for a longitude.
It consists of all coordinates
that have a latitude that is between the two supplied latitude values
and that have a longitude that is between the two supplied longitude values.</p>

<h3>Derived</h3>

<p><em>Deriveds</em> are a special type of object within the Overpass API.
The <em>deriveds</em> are not part of the OpenStreetMap data opposed to <em>nodes</em>, <em>ways</em>, and <em>relations</em>,
but are generated during the runtime of a request.
Using <em>deriveds</em> makes it possible to rewrite tags and to simplify geometries.</p>

<h3>Evaluator</h3>

<p>This is one of the building blocks of a request.
An <em>evaluator</em> is called in the context of a statement, block statement, or the special filter <em>if</em>.
Depending on its type, it either operates on the whole set of objects chosen in a <em>variable</em> or individually on each object.
Again, depending on its type, it returns a number, a string, or a geometry.</p>

<h3>Filter</h3>

<p>This is one of the building blocks of a request.
A <em>filter</em> always belongs to a <em>query</em> statement and filters for the objects to be selected there.
The multiple filters of a query statement are connected by conjunction,
i.e. there are always found only those objects that match all filters of the respective <em>query</em> statement.</p>

<h3>Key</h3>

<p>A <em>key</em> is a part of a <em>tag</em>.
It is the leading string.</p>

<h3>Node</h3>

<p>A specific type of object in the data model of OpenStreetMap.
It represents a single coordinate.
With tags it is a distinguishable object,
without tags it almost always is just a part of a way to equip it with coordinates.</p>

<h3>Request</h3>

<p>The text in the formal query language
that the client (e.g. from the front-end <em>Overpass Turbo</em>) sends to the server.
The content of the request exclusively controls
what out of the OpenStreetMap data is fetched.</p>

<h3>Relation</h3>

<p>A specific type of object in the data model of OpenStreetMap.
It models all things that are beyond the scope of nodes and ways.</p>

<h3>Set</h3>

<p>See at Variable</p>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>This is one of the building blocks of a request.
Statements are those parts that can be independently executed.
Statements can be classified as block statements or simple statements.
The two most important statements are
<em>query</em> to select objects from the OpenStreetMap database
and <em>print</em> to append selected objects to the response.</p>

<h3>Tag</h3>

<p>A <em>tag</em> is a data structure in both OpenStreetMap and the Overpass API to store textual data.
Every tag consists of a <em>key</em> and a <em>value</em>
and is part of an object, i.e. a node, a way, a relation or a derived.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>key</em> is a part of a <em>tag</em>.
It is the trailing string.</p>

<h3>Variable</h3>

<p>A variable in the Overpass API is always a set variable.
Set variables serve during the execution of a request
to convey object selections from statement to statement.</p>

<h3>Way</h3>

<p>A specific type of object in the data model of OpenStreetMap.
It represents a polyline.
If the polyline is closed, then it can be an area.</p>
