to do: database source, initial -- first draft, not draft but copied from my git!!!

Overpass uses its own database, for a database to be useful it needs to have
some data stored / initialed in it. The data used is "Open Street Maps" data,
the same data used to draw the map. OSM data files tend to be huge, they are
available in different sizes for different regions ranging from the whole planet
to cities. For this reason I use data file for the state of Arizona in USA. My
advice is to choose file for your country or region, if you have the resources
and disk space for the whole planet and that is what you want, go for it.

OSM data files come in different types, overpass requires the file to initial
the database to be OSM XML bzip2-compressed - ends with suffix .osm.bz2 usually.
OSM data files may or may not include historical or personal data; this is known
as "META" data. I would choose this type of file if available for your area.
The OSM "osmium command line tool" is used to convert between file types. I 
have a SlackBuild script for the tool on my repository that you may need:

Data source for downloads:

Check this wiki page URL: "https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm" for
downloading OSM files. Choose and download your file (country, city or the whole
planet).
A great web site for OSM files extract is at the following URL, you may want to
get your area file from:
URL:  {  https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/index.html  }.


2) Populate the database:

A) Decision time:
   At this point you need to decide where to store the database.
   Store the database on SSD (Solid State Drive) if you have one, or your fast
   hard drive. you need to make sure you have enough space for the database.
   The time it takes to populate the database depends on the input file size
   and your processor / machine speed.
   
   Where you store the database is the overpass user home directory we used
when created the overpass group and user. If you need to make any changes to
that, now is the time before you initial the database.

[TO BE CONTINUED]

   The input file to initial / populate the database is OSM file. And OSM (Open
   Street Map) files are of many types. Usually you can tell the type by the
   file suffix. The OSM command line tool "Osmium" is used to work with files;
   you can use "osmium" to convert from type to another, get information about
   a file and many other uses. You can find a Slackware build script for osmium
   on my repository. The file type required to initial the database is ".osm.bz2"
   type. Read more about OSM data files at:

     https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs

   In short your input file name needs to end with ".osm.bz2". To add to the mix;
   files may include "meta data" or extra data.
   A shell script is provided with the software to download and clone database.
   I have NOT used this script. If you want you can use "download_clone.sh".

   This is what I did; I live in Phoenix, Arizona so I got a file for the state
   of Arizona with meta data and used that to initial my database.
   To download your file go to this web site:

        https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/index.html

   and choose your file - for state, country, region or planet.
   If you choose a file with meta data - not available in ".osm.bz2" type - then
   you need to convert it with "osmium" to .osm.bz2 type with this command:
    $ osmium cat yourfile.osm.pbf -o yourfile.osm.bz2

   Before leaving this section, we are going to make our decisions / assumptions
   as follow:
     - Store database under /home directory since there is enough disk space,
       so we make a directory as root with the name of "overpass";
       # mkdir /home/overpass
       I will refer to the /home part of the path above as {DB_ROOT}, so place
       your database directory anywhere you want.
     - The input file I will use has meta data with the name "infile.osm.bz2"

C) Initial The Data Base:
   With the above assumptions we initial the data base using "init_osm3s.sh"
   provided with the software; this script takes three arguments and one
   command option as follows:
   1) infile: is the input file; has to be of type .osm.bz2
   2) data base directory: where to store the data base - destination
   3) executable directory: this is the bin directory root where overpass is
      installed - /usr/local/ without the bin entery.
   4) the meta option: if infile has no meta data, then change to "--meta=no".

   Do the following to initial data base:
   - As root user change user to overpass with:
     root@lazyant:~# su overpass <enter>

   - Then your prompt should look like this on your terminal:
     overpass@lazyant:/root$

     And whoami and its output should look like:
     overpass@lazyant:/root$ whoami
     overpass

     Assuming everything is good; change directory to where you placed your
     "infile.osm.bz2" and initial the data base with:

     overpass@lazyant:/root$ nohup init_osm3s.sh infile.osm.bz2 "{DB_ROOT}/overpass/" "/usr/local/" --meta&

     Replace {DB_ROOT} above with your real path.

     My actual infile.osm.bz2 was "arizona-latest-internal.osm.bz2" for the
     state of Arizona with file size about 300 MB, on my machine the above
     command to initial the data base took about 32 minutes, with directory
     size about about 17 GB. YMMV!

   With those steps so far, you can query your data base on the command line.
   Using the example file provided with this README; and please replace with
   good points from your database input file:

     $ osm3s_query --db-dir={DB_ROOT}/overpass < example

   above assumes you are in the directory where the example file is.

Data base updates will not be covered here. See documentation in your
installation for that, or check online :)
