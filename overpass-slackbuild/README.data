This is the "README.data" file for overpass Slackware package.

IMPOTRANT: This is work in progress, may also have inacurate information.

The "data" is the subject in this file; the data inside the overpass database.
Here you will find the source; where and what to get for your database, the
destination for it (where to store), how to initial the database with that data
and finally how to make it available for use on your machine (setup). The
data is OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.

Terminology:  meta and attic.

Meta: extra information such as objects versions, timestamps (create, change)
and the editing user information (ids and other things). Data files with "meta"
can have full or partial extra information.

Attic: attic data is historical data, things change, street names even city name
can change (Bombay to Mumbai, India), other things may change in the database.
Quoting from overpassAPI installation: "Since Overpass API v0.7.50, it is possible
to also retain previous object versions, the so called attic versions, in the
database. Previous object versions are accessible via [date:...], [diff:...],
[adiff:...] as well as some filters like (changed:...)." end quote.

Populate (initial) database in 2 different ways:
The first is to use the "download_clone.sh" script provided with overpassAPI
source (find it in /usr/local/bin if you install using my SlackBuild script).
I have not tried this method, I do not mean to bash the script and I do really
appreciate that it is available. The script is easy way to clone the WHOLE
database from the server, no partial option. You may choose without attic or
meta data, but you still get the whole planet data.
I do not know the acctual size of the database - has to be in the 100s of GBs.
I do know that I do not have the hard disk space on my machine for it. I also
do not want to guess how long it will take to download or think of how to ensure
the integrity of the data. Please see the complete installation page (in the html
directory of the package) for "download_clone.sh" usage.
If you have the resources for this and have done it, please let me know, I would
love to hear from you.

The second method to initial the database is from data file from OpenStreetMaps.
The OSM data file can be for planet or smaller areas. They are available for
regions devided by countries, continents or even smaller areas like cities.
This is the method I chose for myself and describe here. You have total control
of what to include in your database.

OSM data files formats:

The data used in overpass database is "Open Street Maps" data, the same data
used to draw the map. OSM data files tend to be huge resulting in big database.
For this reason I use data file for the state of Arizona in the USA where I live.
My advice is to choose file for your country or region, if you have the resources
disk space (maybe one terabyte) for the whole planet and that is what you want,
get the planet data file and go for it.

OSM data files come in different types, overpass requires the file to initial
the database to be OSM XML bzip2-compressed - ends with suffix .osm.bz2.
Your source file may not be available in this format, do not worry you can
convert it to this required format.
The OSM "osmium command line tool" is used to convert between file types among
other functions on OSM files. I have a SlackBuild script for the tool on my
repository that you may need:

https://github.com/waelhammoudeh/osmium-tool_slackbuild

With osmium you may download a file with say "PBF" format then convert it to
bz2 format. For example this was exactly what I did, my source was in "pbf" and
I had to convert it with the following command:

 $ osmium cat arizona-internal.osh.pbf -o arizona-internal.osh.bz2

note that -o switch specifies output file name and from its suffix "osmium"
will figure out the format for output. See the man page for osmium. This
operation can take some time depending on file size, processor and amount
of memory on the machine. Mine run for about 10 minutes to finish.
Another note; some web sites may use slightly different suffix for file formats
".osh.bz2".Just make sure the file format is compressed bz2.

OSM data files may or may not include "META" data (see Terminology above). Yes
you can save disk space without meta data, but your query results will not be
accurate, I would also argue that the query result is wrong. In short meta data
can include essential information, so choose a source file with meta data. You
can query overpass using other programs such as JSOM; which requires meta data.

As for the attic data; you accumulate data as you update your database over the
time you use it, there is a way to keep old objects while updating database.

Data source for downloads:

There are a lot of web sites that provide OSM data files (or extracts). Here are
two good sites to start, you can use any site you like, I would choose one close
to me for download then will (should be) faster.

Check this wiki page has alot of links to providers URL:

 { https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm }

Choose and download your file (country, city or the whole planet).

A great web site for OSM files extract is at the following URL, you may want to
get your area file from:

URL:  {  https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/index.html  }.

Pay attention to the file size you choose, that size is NOT for your database!
It is obviuoslly related to your final database size. My original download size
for "arizona-internal.osh.pbf" was about 319 MB, when converted to bz2
"arizona-internal.osh.bz2" it got bigger to 521 MB and my database after I
did the initialization to it was 17 GB. So I recommend free space of at least
30 to 50 GB to be on the safe side for a single small country. You are going
to need a lot more disk space for a continent.

Database home - storage:

Where you store the database is the overpass user home directory we used
when created the overpass group and user. If you need to make any changes to
that, now is the time before you initial the database.

At this point you need to decide where to store the database. Store the database
on SSD (Solid State Drive) if you have one, or your fast hard drive, the faster
the drive the less time for the query result since there will be a lot of file I/O.
You need to make sure you have enough space for the database. I can not till
you how much since it depends on your area, but I think minimum will be 50 GB.
The time it takes to populate the database depends on the input file size and
your processor / machine speed and amount of memory.


[TO BE CONTINUED]

TO DO:
overpass user initials DB ...
setup rc.dispatcher ...

   Before leaving this section, we are going to make our decisions / assumptions
   as follow:
     - Store database under /home directory since there is enough disk space,
       so we make a directory as root with the name of "overpass";
       # mkdir /home/overpass
       I will refer to the /home part of the path above as {DB_ROOT}, so place
       your database directory anywhere you want.
     - The input file I will use has meta data with the name "infile.osm.bz2"

C) Initial The Data Base:
   With the above assumptions we initial the data base using "init_osm3s.sh"

   script usage is:
   init_osm3s.sh infile $DBDIR $EXECDIR [option]

   option is one of:
   empty - nothing --> database without meta data.
   --meta --> database with meta data
   --keep-attic --> database with meta data plus attic

   $ /usr/local/bin/init_osm3s.sh inputfile.bz2 "/home/overpass/" "/usr/local/" --meta &

   provided with the software; this script takes three arguments and one
   command option as follows:
   1) infile: is the input file; has to be of type .osm.bz2
   2) data base directory: where to store the data base - destination
   3) executable directory: this is the bin directory root where overpass is
      installed - /usr/local/ without the bin entery.
   4) the meta option: The presence of "--meta" option will result in database
        with metadata and the absence of the option will result in database
        without metadata. If option is set to --keep-attic then database will
        have metadata plus attic data.

   Do the following to initial data base:
   - As root user change user to overpass with:
     root@lazyant:~# su overpass <enter>

   - Then your prompt should look like this on your terminal:
     overpass@lazyant:/root$

     And whoami and its output should look like:
     overpass@lazyant:/root$ whoami
     overpass

     Assuming everything is good; change directory to where you placed your
     "infile.osm.bz2" and initial the data base with:

     overpass@lazyant:/root$ nohup /usr/local/bin/init_osm3s.sh infile.osm.bz2 "{DB_ROOT}/overpass/" "/usr/local/" --meta &

     You need full path for the script: /usr/local/bin/init_osm3s.sh above.
     Replace {DB_ROOT} above with your real path.

     My actual infile.osm.bz2 was "arizona-latest-internal.osm.bz2" for the
     state of Arizona with file size about 300 MB, on my machine the above
     command to initial the data base took about 32 minutes, with directory
     size about about 17 GB. YMMV!

   With those steps so far, you can query your data base on the command line.
   Using the example file provided with this README; and please replace with
   good points from your database input file:

     $ osm3s_query --db-dir={DB_ROOT}/overpass < example

   above assumes you are in the directory where the example file is.

Data base updates will not be covered here. See documentation in your
installation for that, or check online :)
