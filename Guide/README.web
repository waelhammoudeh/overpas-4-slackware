TODO: web server setup. .... still TODO copied from my git

3) Setup Apatche Web Server:

    With full installation of Slackware, the Apache web server is installed by
    httpd package. This package includes one of the best documentation in open
    source software; you can find the documentation on your system at:
       /var/www/htdocs/manual/index.html

    There are a lot of guides, howtos and articales available on the web to
    setup the Apache web server on a Slackware machine. So I am not going to
    reinvent the wheel. One such document is here:
        https://docs.slackware.com/howtos:network_services:setup_apache

    You are going to modify the main configuration file, one tool (command) to
    be aware of is:
        "apachectl -t"
    this checks your configuration file for syntax errors.

    Slackware provides a script to start and stop the Apache server. That script
    is "/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd", assuming the script is executable, then you can start
    the server with:

     # /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd start

    And you stop the server with:

    # /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd stop

    If you make the script executable with "$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd" then
    Slackware will start Apache every time you boot your machine, and stops
    Apache server on shutdown.

    The file to modify is: /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, use a text editor, emacs or
    kate or whatever text editor you like. It is in sections, there is a full
    example configuration file in this Guide directory "httpd.conf.example", it is
    usable, but use at your own risk. Few points about this example configuration
    file are as follow:

    1) In the Listen section "Listen 80", sets Apache to listen in all network
       devices in the system.

    2) Your localhost server is redfined in the virtual host section.

    3) The server Root Document is set to "/usr/local/html/overpass" which is
       part of the installed package - assuming you used my SlackBuild to build
       and install. This setting is done by the line:

            DocumentRoot "/usr/local/html/overpass"

    4) The ScriptAlias directive in htppd.conf instructs the server to look for
       scripts in "/usr/local/cgi-bin/", this directory is also produced and
       included by the overpass Slackware package. This setting is done by:

            ScriptAlias /api/ /usr/local/cgi-bin/

    Using the provided example to configure your Apache server, you can access
    your overpass server on the SAME machine you installed it by entering this
    address in your browser:

       http://localhost

    Note about Network - small area and home network:
    If you have your home network setup and you use STATIC IP addresses with it,
    by including this line in all your "/etc/hosts" files on your computers:

        xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx     myoverpass.local        myoverpass

    <Replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx above with IP for overpass machine>.
    I used tabs to make things more clear, single space is good in "/etc/hosts".

    Then you can access your overpass server from other machines on your small
    area or home network with:

        "http://myoverpass
            OR
        http://myoverpass.local"

    in a browser address bar

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
W.H.
