This is the main "README" file for the overpass installation and setup Guide.

Guide details are provided in seperate README files as follows:

 *) README - this file you are reading now:
     Provide hardware requirements and software installation.
     Software provide tools to initial, maintain and query database.

 *) README-DATA.md:
     Essential information about OSM data files.

 *) README-SETUP.md
     Setting up the data in such a way to make it ready for use, including database
     initialization, start the daemon dispatcher, area creation, then maintaining and
     keeping data updated. Finally automation of this process.

  *) README.web :
      Has details for setting up Apache web server for the web user interface
      to overpass.

Hardware Requirements:

From the "Complete Installation Guide" that comes with the software:
 "Concerning hardware, I suggest at least 4 GB of RAM. The more RAM is available,
 the better, because caching of disk content in the RAM will significantly speed
 up Overpass API. The processor speed will have little relevance. For the hard
 disk, it depends on what you want to install. A full planet database with
 minutely updates will require 100s of GB and is out of the scope of this repository.
 Here we are using extracts for limited area. The amount of OSM data file will
 vary from country to country depending on a lot of things. The data file
 for the United States is a lot bigger than the data file for the state of Arizona
 that I use. My database directory size is under 30 GB for Arizona with meta
 data included. My guess is you need any where from 50 to 250 GB of free
 disk space.

This is my opinion for hardware:
  1- CPU: any multicore 64 bit - no 32 bit please.
  2- RAM: At least 4 GB.
  3- Hard disk: Solid State Drive is better than magnetic with at least 70 GB free space.

Software Installation:

Important Notes:
 - The included SlackBuild script compiles the overpassAPI software from source,
   package destination {PKGDEST} installation root is set to /usr/local/.
 - The build script creates THREE new directories under /usr/local/ with names
   "cgi-bin", "templates" and "rules".
 - Blog directory along with overpass-doc are added to the package in the
   html directory; for educational purposes. Available on the web online too.
 - This build script replaces the tar ball source "index.html" file in the html
    directory with that used in an earlier version 0.7.55.9.
 - The build script does NOT setup any web server, however it makes the process
   much easier.
 - Included in the package by my SlackBuild script are three helper scripts:
   1) initial_op_db.sh : script to initial overpass database.
   2) op_ctl.sh: overpass control script.
   3) rc.dispatcher: used in system startup and shutdown scripts.
 
Required before building package:
You need to create "overpass" group and user before building overpassAPI, and
set ownership on overpass home directory. Overpass directory is where you will
store your database on your system, you should have enough free space to
store your database.

The following commands will accomplish those requirements:

   # groupadd -g 367 overpass
   # useradd -u 367 -g 367 -d /your/overpass/directory overpass
   # mkdir /your/overpass/directory
   # chown overpass:overpass /your/overpass/directory

Replace "/your/overpass/directory" with your actual overpass home directory;
where you will store your database. You do need to create the directory and set
its ownership.

Thanks to Robby Workman from SlackBuilds.org for issuing and including the
above ids in the "Recommended UID/GIDs" document in their site. This avoids
conflicts with software installed from SlackBuilds.org, so I highly recommend
you use the above group and user ids. Feel free to use different gid/uid above,
look in your /etc/group and /etc/passwd files first!!!

The short story:
The goal is to setup overpassAPI server on a local machine with a limited area
database for a region, compiling  and installing the software is a first step.
After installing the package, we can move to the next step; get the data to
populate the database, initial the database and then setup web server for our
own overpass server.

To accomplish our goal follow these steps:
1) Create user and group as outlined above in "Required before building".
2) Build the package with SlackBuild script and install it on your machine.
3) Download open street maps data for your area and initial the database.
4) Start overpass "dispatcher" dameon to manage the database.

To have dispatcher start and stop on your system boot and shutdown; add the
following lines to the following files, (after database setup):

 /etc/rc.d/rc.local
 ============================
 # Startup overpass dispatcher
 if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.dispatcher ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.dispatcher start
 fi

 /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
 ============================
 # Stop overpass dispatcher
 if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.dispatcher ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.dispatcher stop
 fi

You may need to create the "/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown" if not present in your
system. The rc.dispatcher script has other options; please see the script file.

5) Database needs to be updated periodically or automatically, scripts are
provided for this and an automation process is described and implemented.

6) Setup a web server such as "Apache Web Server" for your overpass server, enable
internet access to your database.

The long story is broken into files mentioned on top of this README, so
please see "README-DATA.md", "README-SETUP.md" and "README.web".
Thank you very much.

Enjoy :)
